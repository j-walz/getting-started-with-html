  <!--The head is one of the first tags in an html document.  It contains the metadata of the document, such as the js location, css location and title of the document.-->

  <!--The title tag holds the title of the document and will appear in the tab of the user's browser.  -->

  <h1>How the Internet Works</h1>
  <!--The h tag is a header tag that comes in different sizes, 1-6, giving a wide variety of uses.-->
  <p>The <b>internet</b> is the worlds largest network of computers.  Basically it is just a web for computers<br> to talk to other computers, but on a giant scale.  The <b>user</b> will get on a <b>browser</b> and send a request<br> over the <b>internet</b> to a <b>web server</b> that is hosting what ever information the <b>user</b> wants. The <b>web server</b><br> then repsonds to the <b>user</b> with the information request and sends it back across the <b>internet</b> to appear on the <b>user's browser</b>.</p>
  <!--The p tag is to set paragraphs.  It is a block tag.  The b tag sets the text to bold and is an inline tag.  The br tag puts a new line (/n) and is an inline tag as well. -->
  <h1>HTML</h1>
  <p><em>HTML</em> is the basic language of the internet.  Almost all of the web pages on the internet are written using <em>HTML</em>.<br><em>HTML</em> documents can contain links, images, text, video, and much more.  The way that these different elements<br> of an <em>HTML</em> document are written into the document are with <em>tags</em>.  <em>Tags</em> are markers that notify the <em>HTML</em> document<br> that a specified set of text is not just text but an insrtuction of how to treat other sets of text.  <em>Tags</em> are surrounded by < and ><br> with the closing <em>tag</em> having a / infront of it.  This is so the <em>HTML</em> document knows how to treat that text, and then the <em>tags</em><br> themselves surround the bit of text that they are affecting.  An example of a <em>tag</em> is the b tag, which tells the <em>HTML</em> document<br> that all of the text inbetween the opening and closing b tags should be bold.</p>
  <p>Together a <em>tag</em> and the text that that<em>tag</em> is affecting are called and <em>element</em>.  There are two types of <em>elements</em>, <em>inline</em><br> and <em>block</em>.  <em>Inline elements</em> keep the element within the line of text and do not add anything extra to the text.<br>  <em>Block elements</em> put an invisible box around the text that the writer can use to set that bit of text apart from others.
  <!--The em tag is the emphasis tag.  It puts the affected text in italics.  It is an inline element. -->
  <h1> Thinking Like a Computer</h1>
  <p>Computers do exactly what they are told, but what they are told is not always what is meant.  To have think like<br> a computer is to be able to think in systematic steps.  One must take everything one step at a time and without<br> assuming any intetnion that may seemt to be built into the intrusction.  This can be fairly difficult and requires much practice.
